= Prototyping with Tool Calling

== Basic Tool Calling

Open up the following notebook in your workspace.

In this notebook we will introduce how to build a simple agent using Llama Stack's agent framework, enhanced with a single tool: the builtin web search tool.

We will cover the agent basics. This is an important step toward developing a more capable and autonomous agent.

== Prompt Chaining

Open up the following notebook in your workspace.

In this notebook we will build on the simple agent introduced in [simple agent workflows](3-agents-tools/2-simple-agent-with-websearch). This tutorial continues the agent-focused section of our series by introducing techniques that make the agent smarter and more autonomous: **Prompt Chaining** and the **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) framework**.

These approaches allow the agent to complete multi-step tasks, dynamically choose tools, and adjust its behavior based on context.
