= Pre-requisites to get started

=== Team Setup
* Teams of 2 people per cluster
* Login credentials for the OpenShift cluster
* Fork of the Git repository

=== Cluster Environment
The workshop environment includes:
* Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) with GPU support
* Node Feature Discovery (NFD) for GPU detection
* Bootstrap components:
** Advanced Cluster Management (ACM) + ArgoCD
** Vault for secrets management
** Observability stack
** LLM Granite model with MaaS integration
** Pipeline infrastructure in failing state
** Containerfile + BuildConfig/Tekton Pipeline for as a Service (initially disabled)
** Workbench creation with RBAC

=== Required Applications
* Vault setup with API tokens:
** Tavily search token
** GitHub token
** MaaS credentials
* Workbench environment for development
* Access to the use case scenario and supporting documentation

=== Technical Knowledge
* Basic understanding of OpenShift/Kubernetes concepts
* Familiarity with Python programming
* Knowledge of containerization concepts
* Basic understanding of CI/CD pipelines

= The Use Case

Acme Inc. is facing issues within their CI/CD system, and they're asking you to build a Gen AI based solution for them.

== The Challenge

Acme Inc. has a critical CI/CD pipeline that frequently fails due to various issues such as:
* Build failures due to dependency conflicts
* Deployment errors caused by configuration mismatches
* Resource constraints leading to timeouts
* Integration test failures requiring manual investigation

The current process requires developers to:
* Manually investigate error logs
* Search through documentation for solutions
* Create GitHub issues for tracking problems
* Manually restart failed pipelines
* Coordinate with team members for resolution

This manual intervention is:
* Time-consuming and delays releases
* Error-prone due to human oversight
* Not scalable as the team grows
* Lacking consistent documentation of solutions

== The Solution: AI-Powered CI/CD Agent

We will build an intelligent agent that can:
* Detect and analyze CI/CD failures
* Interact with OpenShift to query cluster resources and pod status
* Search for relevant solutions using web search and documentation
* Provide actionable recommendations to developers
* Create GitHub issue in the specified repository for tracking
