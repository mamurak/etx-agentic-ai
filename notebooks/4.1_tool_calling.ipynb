    "# Notebook 4.1: Simple Agent with Tool Calling\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will introduce how to build a simple agent using Llama Stack's agent framework, enhanced with a single tool: the builtin web search tool. This capability will  allow the agent to retrieve up to date external information beyond the limits of its training data. This is an important step toward developing a more capable and autonomous agent. Make sure you have setup your environment OK in [Level 1](Level1_getting_started_with_Llama_Stack.ipynb)\n",

    "- **Agent Initialization**: First we create an `Agent` instance with the desired LLM model, agent instructions and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instructions**: The `instructions` parameter, also referred to as the system prompt, specifies the agent's role and behavior. In this example, the agent is configured as a helpful web search assistant. It is instructed to use a tool whenever a web search is required and to respond in a friendly and helpful tone.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **How It Works**: When a user query is provided, the agent processes the input and determines whether a tool is required to fulfill the request. If the query involves retrieving information from the web, the agent invokes the `builtin::websearch` tool. The tool interacts with Tavily Search to fetch real-time data, which is then processed and returned to the user in a friendly and helpful tone. This workflow ensures that the agent can handle a wide range of queries effectively.\n",

This is particularly impressive given that the model that we are using here was released in September 2024 and has a knowledge cutoff of December 2023. These results were only possible due to its ability to call tools like web search, demonstrating the agent's capacity to retrieve real-time data effectively."
